CHANGE_LOG

For the Github commit log see here: https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/commits/master
 
v1.239  October 14, 2018
    User interface improvements:
        'x' and 'y' shortcut keys toggle control panel, top bar visibility respectively.
 
v1.238  October 7, 2018
    TDoA extension:
        Changed mapping provider. BETA TEST. There are known problems, but it is better
        than the currently broken Google map. Use "gmap:" in URL to use old Google maps,
        e.g. "?ext=tdoa,gmap:"
 
v1.237  October 2, 2018
    Fix bug causing server crash-loop on update if WSPR auto-run enabled.
 
v1.236  October 1, 2018
    Changed timezone lookup providers.
 
v1.235  September 30, 2018
    Christoph's fixes for clean web socket connection closing.
 
v1.234  September 29, 2018
    Increase receiver DDC channel NCO phase word width from 32 to 48 bits.
        This stops all rotation of (ground wave) LF/VLF signals on the IQ extension display
        caused by increased quantization of NCO phase for low receive frequencies when
        a phase word of only 32-bits is used.

v1.233  September 28, 2018
    Fixed precision bug in mixer NCO value computation.

v1.232  September 25, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New checkbox to select Christoph's improved TDoA algorithm. Original algorithm still available.
            To select in URL use "new:" e.g. "... &ext=tdoa, ... ,new:,submit:"

v1.231  September 22, 2018
    Add "click to start" overlay now that Safari 12 implements auto-play restrictions.

v1.230  September 19, 2018
    CW decoder: add filter output graph with threshold indicator.
    Fix Google timezone lookups.

v1.229  September 18, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Require 4 decoding errors before re-train. (previously just 1)
        Added error count indicator.
        Specifying extension argument fixes decoder filter frequency and disables passband tracking.
            e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?ext=cw,500
    In addition to specifying passband "/pbw" and "/lo,hi" in URL and frequency entry box
        can now also specify ":pbc" and ":pbc,pbw" to easily change passband center.
    Added event notification API for the benefit of CATSync.

v1.226,227,228  September 17, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Realtime fixes.
        Added checkbox for "word space correction".
            Change when spacing between words is consistently wrong.
        Added checkbox for "threshold correction".
            Checking seems to help with weak signal decoding.
        Added a button which resets the code.
        Added a "train" indicator that lights when code speed training is active.

v1.225  September 16, 2018
    CW decoder extension fixes.

v1.224  September 15, 2018
    Added CW decoder extension.

v1.223  September 12, 2018
    CIC filter compensation via empirical measurement.
    Minor TDoA UI improvements.

v1.222  September 11, 2018
    Re-enabled the AM post-detector FIR filter after fixing the underlying problem as the
        FIR filter is needed to workaround the known issue with CIC filter droop.
    TDoA extension improvements:
        "rerun" button: reruns the TDoA calculation using the existing samples.
            Useful when you just want to adjust the map position/zoom or remove a
            station's samples from the list and then recalculate.
        If any of the TDoA result maps are selected when the submit or rerun buttons
            are pressed then the position/zoom of the result map is used for the new run.
            Previously only the Kiwi map position/zoom was ever used.
            

v1.220,221  September 9, 2018
    Added audio FFT in the waterfall/spectrum for those channels where the regular
        multi-level zoom waterfall/spectrum is not available.

v1.219  August 30, 2018
    Christoph's fix for web socket close.
    Update Galileo sat list.
    Admin control tab option to disable all waterfall/spectrum display.
        By request. This option saves Internet bandwidth.
        Doesn't include audio FFT waterfall which consumes no additional Internet bandwidth.

v1.218  August 20, 2018
    Solution for the GPS "diminishing fixes" problem.

v1.217  August 20, 2018
    Fixed negative passband values in URL.

v1.216  August 7, 2018
    All 12 GPS channels now support any satellite type (Navstar/QZSS/Galileo).
    Do URL redirect if configured and Kiwi is marked down.

v1.215  August 3, 2018
    New admin config parameters to set external ADC clock frequency and GPS correction.
    Other ADC clock control improvements in IQ extension and "cal ADC clock" menu item.
    Fix race causing incorrect inactivity timeouts under certain circumstances.
    Passband can be specified in the "f=" URL parameter, format same as frequency entry box.
        See: http://kiwisdr.com/quickstart/index.html#id-user-tune
        This is an alternative to specifying the passband alone with "pbw=" or "pb=" parameters.

v1.214  August 1, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Fix for TDoA with a mix of RX4 and RX8 mode Kiwis (GPS timestamp offset).
        Get reference station list from kiwisdr.com instead of hardwired in code.
        Keep selected Kiwi and reference markers out of marker clusters.

v1.213  July 31, 2018
    RX8WF2 mode
        Fix detection of all channels busy.
        Added "no_wf" URL parameter to force non-waterfall channel to be used, e.g.
            my_kiwi:8073/?ext=wspr,40m&mute&no_wf
        In the users list option tab show our channel number in green to distinguish from others.

v1.212  July 30, 2018
    Beta test of RX8WF2 mode: more receiver channels.
        See the new "mode" tab on the admin page for details.

v1.211  July 25, 2018
    Fix TDoA channel limit bug.

v1.210  July 25, 2018
    Correct dictionary-order sort of extension names in lists and menus.
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Added reference station categories.
        Admin page extensions tab lets you limit number of channel used by TDoA service.
        Admin page security tab lets you disable sending GPS timestamps completely.
        Moved "TDoA ID" setting from sdr.hu tab to TDoA tab on extensions page
        Updated help info.

v1.209  July 22, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        When TDoA complete automatically switch to result map.
        Switch option bar to 'off' (and restore) when TDoA running. Obscures the map less.
        Option checkboxes moved to right of map display.
        Added checkboxes to show/hide reference stations and day/night overlay.
        Added more references stations.
    Fix passband width adjustment when passband is offset from carrier (i.e. ssb, cw)
    Use pointer cursor for menus and checkboxes.

v1.208  July 21, 2018
    Commas in frequency entry field work again (broken since keyboard shortcuts added).
    Can now quickly change passband via entry in frequency entry field:
        Type "freq/pbw" or just "/pbw" where pbw is the passband width in Hz
        or the low and high edges with "low,high".
        Examples:
        1234.56             set f=1234.56 as usual
        1234,56             set f=1234.56 using comma as decimal separator
        234.56/1200         set f=234.56 and pbw=1200 around current pb center
        /600                set pbw=600
        /300,3000           set pb=(300,3000) i.e. usb 2700 Hz wide
        7255/-2600,-300     set f=7255 and pbw=(-2600,-300) i.e. lsb 2300 Hz wide
    Facility added to load certain javascript asynchronously (e.g. Google maps).
    
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New URL parameter "submit:" that will automatically start TDoA on webpage load.
            e.g. ...?ext=tdoa,submit:,F1JEK,DL6ECS,SWL/JO21JN,DCF77
            There is a 6 second delay for the initial status inquiries to complete.
        6 character grid square used for ID instead of old "KiwiNNN" (Thanks Martin).
        Duplicate IDs distinguished by appending /N to the ID (N = 2,3,...)
        Multiple Kiwis at identical locations on map dithered slightly so all are visible.
        More reliable communications protocol with server should prevent hangs.
        Submit button changes to a stop button while TDoA running (feature may still have bugs).
        "Most likely position" marker now shown on result maps.
            This in addition to reference position if one has been specified.
        Most likely position lat/lon shown at panel top along with cyan Google map link.
            Triple-click on lat/lon value to copy/paste.
        Green link icon at panel top has URL with current TDoA extension configuration
            Right-click while hovered on link to create configuration bookmark or
            click to open in a new tab/window (less useful).
            Link is continuously updated as map is changed, host list changed etc.
        After sampling each host shows a download icon for the recorded .wav IQ file.

v1.207  July 17, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Allow extension parameters in URL, e.g.
            ...?ext=tdoa,lat:49,lon:7.5,z:6,F1JEK,DL6ECS,DCF77
            Will zoom the map to specified lat/lon/zoom and select specified Kiwis and ref station.
            lat/lon/zoom is displayed at control panel upper right for reference.
        Cluster markers when they are too close together:
            Hover mouse over cluster for list of markers it contains.
            A cluster single-click zooms +1.
            A cluster double-click zooms in to reveal all the markers.
        Show Kiwi markers on new maps (just like they are shown on old maps).
        Second double-click of reference marker goes back to last map position/zoom.
        Kiwi map type selected is carried to result map type.
        Added additional reference stations:
            WWV/B, NMC, KPH, JJY/40/60, NDT/JJI, NDI, JXN, VTX3/4, DCF49/HGA22/DCF39, DDH47

    Added TDoA-service extension. Under development.
    Fixed bug that reduced the frequency of GPS solutions under certain conditions.
    Include GPS good/fix counts in /status URL query.
    Add URL args to redirect URL, e.g. a connection to mykiwi:8073/?f=5000 will redirect to
        mykiwi:8074/?f=5000 if mykiwi:8074 is the configured redirect URL (thanks PK).
    Support Ethernet / WiFi virtual interfaces, e.g. eth0:1
        Some people use this to implement dual IPv4/IPv6 local networks.
    Major w3_util API cleanup including update from W3.css v2.65 to v3.4
    Disable keyboard shortcuts for Firefox <= v52, Chrome <= v49 and Opera <= v36 due to
        browser compatibility problems.
    Use a build directory outside the source tree so that source files can be shared between

    Added external ADC clock selection switch to config tab of admin page.
    Switch to using three new geolocation servers.

v1.190,191  May 10, 2018
    Added keyboard shortcuts. Press "h" or "?" to toggle a help list. Work in progress.
    IQ display extension now supports mPSK (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK) carrier locking.
        See the Kiwi forum for more details.
    DX edit panel:
        1) New "extension" field. Place name of extension and associated parameters in this field
        and the extension will be started when dx label is clicked. Label turns magenta instead of
        yellow when you mouse over the label and an extension has been specified.
        Use ctrl/alt-click to skip starting extension and only select frequency as usual.
        Extension specification is the same as used in the URL "ext=" parameter. See documentation.
        2) New "passband" field. Format is a single number in Hz specifying the width of a
        symmetrical passband around the carrier (i.e. AM or DSB) or two numbers separated by a
        comma or space specifying the low and high passband offsets (e.g. "300, 700" for USB-CW)
    With the above two features you can create a dx label for a STANAG 4285 signal that specifies
        the proper 2400 Hz AM bandwidth (+/- 1200 around carrier) and then a label extension field
        of "iq,density,8PSK".
    FAX extension aligns entire image when shift-click is used.
        Also touch alignment now works on mobile devices.
    Escape key now closes extension and confirmation panels in all cases.

v1.189  May 2, 2018
    Kiwi extensions: convert .c files to .cpp for clang compiler compatibility.

v1.188  May 1, 2018
    Switch compilers from gcc to clang. Build times now twice as fast.
    Add Kiwi URL redirect capability. Allows multiple Kiwis to respond to a single URL.
        See admin page "connect" tab for description.

v1.187  Apr 29, 2018
    Fix timing bug with JSON configuration saves.

v1.180,181,182,183,184,185,186  Apr 27, 2018
    Add WSPR background autorun mode.
        See instructions on admin page, "extensions" tab, WSPR menu entry.

v1.179  Apr 19, 2018
    Fix for Chrome's new "no autoplay" audio policy. Display the "click to start OpenWebRX"
        overlay that is used with iOS mobile devices.
    Fix to eliminate audio glitches when a large dx list is edited/updated from the web interface.

v1.176,177,178  Apr 18, 2018
    The Kiwi GPS now receives Galileo satellites in addition to Navstar and QZSS.
        A GPS antenna with restricted sky visibility will now have more satellites to choose from
        and should produce position/time solutions more often.
        Please consider attaching the GPS antenna to your Kiwi, especially if yours is a
        public Kiwi listed on sdr.hu  This will assist with ongoing HF direction finding experiments
        as well as serve as a source of frequency calibration for your Kiwi.
        Thanks to Christoph Mayer for important insight and bug fixes.
    Admin GPS tab now has Google map display.
    Support Vivado 2017.4 for building FPGA image.

v1.175  Mar 5, 2018

v1.171  Feb 11, 2018
    Admin GPS tab additions.
        Shadow map. Shows long term areas of non-reception caused by "shadowing" of buildings and terrain.
        For Asia/Oceania, a locator for the new geosynchronous QZS-3 sat will appear as a circle.
            Combined with the shadow map this will indicate if QZS-3 is likely to be received.

v1.170  Feb 8, 2018
    Added GPS support for Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).
        Should have reception over entire Asia-Oceania region (heard fine in New Zealand).

        header information and the first 80 characters of the message.

v1.157  Jan 16, 2018
    Fix user display on admin status tab
    Add volume URL parameter, e.g. kiwisdr:8073/?vol=100
        vol = 0 to 200(%), default is 50%

v1.156  Jan 12, 2018
    Fixed FAX frequencies: Athens (way off) and Northwood UK 4 MHz (100 Hz error).
    Added GPS tracking PLL IQ display to admin interface.
    Added scope display to Navtex extension.

v1.155  Jan 3, 2018

v1.154  Jan 2, 2018
    New Navtex extension.
    Major user interface changes:
        New “option tab” user interface for lower right control panel.
        Removed lower left status panel. Replaced with the new "Users" and "Stats" option tabs.
        Next/previous history buttons next to frequency entry box.
            If using a keyboard press return key to select displayed frequency.
            Otherwise prior frequency will return after three seconds.
            Doesn't really work yet for mobile devices.
        Added numeric dBm value to S-meter.
        Added classic LMS denoiser and autonotch to audio tab. Filter controls on extension panel.
            The LMS filters are not a panacea for all filtering problems.
            They are tricky to adjust and don't work in all situations.
            The presets are a work-in-progress.
        Added audio mute icon/button to right of spectrum button (renamed "Spec" to fit).
        WF option tab
            Number after "WF" on option tab button is current zoom level, e.g. "WF10"
            "Auto Scale" button: automatically sets WF min/max.
                Best when there are a range of signal levels.
            "Slow Dev" button: Use when you have audio drops on slow mobile devices (e.g. old iPad).
                Uses single color in spectrum and slower waterfall speed.
            "colormap" & "contrast" menus: beginnings of waterfall colormap control. Work-in-progress.
            "spec filter" menu: variable spectrum time constant so decay time can be varied.
        Add URL parameter to set initial waterfall speed:
            wf={0, off, 1, 1hz, s, slow, m, med, f, fast} e.g. kiwi:8073/?wf=1hz
        Fixed problem with NDB database lookup not working.
